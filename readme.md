# About
Adds commands to Sublime Text that converts RGB colors, in either hex or RGB() format, to HSL colors. For example:

* `#bada55` becomes `hsl(74, 64%, 59%)`
* `rgb(75, 96, 6)` becomes `hsl(74, 88%, 20%)`
* `rgba(117, 149, 9, 0.65)` becomes `hsla(74, 89%, 31%, 0.65)`

In the past, due to browser (IE) compatibility, it was best to use a CSS preprocessor to convert the HSL colors to hex. But now all major browsers [support HSL color](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css3-colors), including IE9+, so you can use HSL colors in CSS unless you need to support IE8.

# Installation
You can install using [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) or you can download or clone the repository and drop it into your Sublime Text packages directory.

# Version 2 Features
* Version 2 now converts hex and RGB to HSL and RGBA to HSLA. The previous version only converted hex to HSL.
* Optionally, you can convert hex, RGB, and RGBA to HSLA (force alpha). 
* You can now convert all hex, RGB, and RGBA colors in a file by inputting the following command twice: (`shift+ctrl+U`).

# Usage
* Convert Selected to HSL:               shift+ctrl+U
* Convert Selected to HSLA:              shift+ctrl+alt+U
* Convert All to HSL (preserving alpha): shift+ctrl+U     + shift+ctrl+U
* Convert All to HSLA (force alpha):     shift+ctrl+alt+U + shift+ctrl+alt+U

# Why No Hex/HSL to RGB support
HSL color is just better than hex or RGB ([Brandon Mathis](http://brandonmathis.com/blog/2011/03/02/hslpicker.com-released/) gives a good explanation why HSL rocks). I don't see any use for RGB—HSL is just more intuitive and makes it much easier to [combine colors](http://www.colorsontheweb.com/combiningcolors.asp) into a logical color scheme.

If you have the need to convert to RGB, you might try the [CSS Color Converter](https://github.com/TheDutchCoder/ColorConvert) plugin.
